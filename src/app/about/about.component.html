            <p>
              It was the dream of all us three to design a website from the days of college, 
              to show the presence and stories of our life on Internet for outer world, 
              but couldn’t succeed even at the time you are reading this page. 
              Time changes the goal from telling stories to solving technical day to day issues 
              and motivated us for foundation of GYANSTACK on real grounds.
